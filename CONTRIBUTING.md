# Contributing

Hello! Please read more about [participating in the Transitland project](https://transit.land/participate/). We welcome comments, questions, and contributions by GitHub issues or [e-mail](mailto:hello@transitland.org).

## Data import issues

If you are trying to report an issue adding a feed to Transitland using the Feed Registry interface, [please open an issues on the transitland/transitland repo and tag it with `data questions/debugging`](https://github.com/transitland/transitland/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22data+questions%2Fdebugging%22). The issue may involve investigation into multiple repositories, so we use `transitland/transitland` as the place to collect these data bug reports.
